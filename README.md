Hi, I'm Omar ðŸ‘‹ a Computer Science graduate.

I'm a motivated developer who enjoys bringing things together; like combining ideas from different areas or using various technologies in a project.
My strong technical skills are backed by a solid academic background in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. 
Additionally, I'm eager and dedicated to knowledge that contributes to my personal and professional growth because I highly believe that software engineering requires  a life-learning process commitment.
